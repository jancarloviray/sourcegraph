# Development README

The best way to become familiar with the Sourcegraph repository is by
reading the code at https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph.

## Environment

Before you can develop Sourcegraph you'll need to set up a
development environment. Here's what you need:

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (v1.5.0 or higher)
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v4.0.0 or higher)
- [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (v1.8 or higher)
- [PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) (v9.2 or higher)
- [Redis](http://redis.io/) (v3.0.7 or higher)
- [protoc](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/v3.0.0-beta-1#c-installation---unix) (v3.0.0-beta-1)

If you are new to Go, you should also [set up your `GOPATH`](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH)
(a directory which contains all your projects).

### Optional (but highly recommended)

- [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new): Register
  your local instance of Sourcegraph as a GitHub OAuth application to
  enable users to connect their GitHub account. This enables higher
  rate limits against the GitHub API.

## Get the code

Then, clone the `sourcegraph` repository into `$GOPATH/src/sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph`

```
go get sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph
```

## PostgreSQL

[Install PostgreSQL](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) then run through the
steps to [initialize and configure your database](https://sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph@master/-/blob/docs/storage.md).

Finally, issue the following commands to set up your database tables:

```
src pgsql --db=app create
src pgsql --db=graph create
```

## Redis

You can follow the [instructions to install Redis natively](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart). If you have Docker installed, however, the easiest way to get Redis up and running is probably:

```
docker run -p 6379:6379 -v $redis-data-dir redis
```

## Build

Make sure your `$GOPATH` is set and your `$PATH` includes `$GOPATH/bin`:

```
echo $GOPATH # should print something
echo $PATH # should include $GOPATH/bin
```

Then in your terminal run:

`cd $GOPATH/src/sourcegraph.com/sourcegraph/sourcegraph`

The Docker daemon should be running in the background, which you can test by
running `docker ps`. If you're on OS X, you may have to run:

```
docker-machine start default
eval $(docker-machine env)
```

Then run:

```
make dep
make serve-dev
```

This will continuously compile your code and live reload your locally running
instance of Sourcegraph. Navigate your browser to http://localhost:3080 to
see if everything worked.

`make serve-dev` may ask you to run ulimit to increase the maximum number
of available file descriptors for a process. You can make this setting
permanent for every shell session by adding the following line to your
`.*rc` file (usually bash or zsh):

```bash
# increase max number of file descriptors for running a sourcegraph instance.
ulimit -n 10000
```

You can also compile and install `src` directly:
```
go install ./cmd/src
src -h
```


## Test

To run all tests:

```
make test
```

To run tests within a directory (and recursively within its
subdirectories):

```
go test ./app/...
```

To run a specific package's tests:

```
go test ./util/textutil
```

## govendor

The Sourcegraph repository uses
[govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor) to manage Go dependencies.

## Codegen

The Sourcegraph repository relies on code generation triggered by `go
generate`. Code generation is used for a variety of tasks:

* generating code for mocking interfaces
* generate wrappers for interfaces (e.g., `./server/internal/middleware/*` packages)
* pack app templates and assets into binaries

To re-generate codegenned code, install `protoc` version `v3.0.0-beta-1`, see
[installation instructions](https://github.com/google/protobuf/tree/v3.0.0-beta-1#c-installation---unix).

Then run:

```
make generate
```

Note that you should always run this after you run `govendor sync` to
update dependencies.

Also, sometimes there are erroneous diffs. This occurs for a few
reasons, none of which are legitimate (i.e., they are tech debt items
we need to address):

* The codegen tool might emit code that depends on system
  configuration, such as the system timezone. We need to submit PRs to
  the tools to eliminate these issues.
* You might have existing but gitignored files that the codegen tools
  read on your disk that other developers don't have. (This occurs for
  app assets especially.)

If you think a diff is erroneous, don't commit it. Add a tech debt
item to the issue tracker and assign the person who you think is
responsible (or ask).

## Code standards

The Sourcegraph repository enforces some code standards via `make
test`, which is also run in CI.

Read more about our style in [docs/style.md](docs/style.md).

## Windows notes

Windows support for Sourcegraph is currently in alpha. A few extra
steps are required to run Sourcegraph in a Windows environment:

- Sourcegraph depends on some GNU and open-source command line tools
  like `make`, `sh`, and `find`. Install Cygwin from
  http://cygwin.org/ (tested with 2.2.1 x32).
- Install Git from http://git-scm.com rather than use Cygwin's
  default Git, which does not properly handle local repositories.
- Configure your Git to use Unix-style line endings.
- Unix symlinks must be converted to Windows symlimks. This does not
  happen automatically (see
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5917249/git-symlinks-in-windows).
  After checking out Sourcegraph, run `bash
  dev/git-windows-aliases.sh` to install the git aliases needed to do
  the conversion. Then run `git rm-symlinks` from the repository root
  to convert all symlinks into Windows symlinks and mark them as "not
  changed" (necessary to avoid issues related to running npm-based
  tasks).

Note that multiple unit tests currently fail on Windows.
